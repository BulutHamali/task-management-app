# 📝 Task Management App

This is a simple Task Management App built using HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.

## 🔍 What It Does

- Add tasks with a name, category, deadline, and status (e.g., Not Started, In Progress, Completed).
- Update the status of each task.
- Automatically marks tasks as **Overdue** if the deadline has passed and the task is not completed.
- Filter tasks by status (like "Completed" or "Overdue").
- Saves all tasks to your browser's local storage — so your tasks stay saved even if you refresh the page.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Fill in the task form with task details.
2. Click the **Add Task** button.
3. Your task will appear in the list below.
4. You can change the task's status using the dropdown.
5. Use the filter dropdown to view only certain types of tasks.

## 💡 Features

- Bootstrap for responsive design
- JavaScript for interactivity
- Local storage to save tasks
- Automatic overdue status detection
- Filter by task status

## 🧠 Reflection

During this project, I learned how to work with forms, arrays, objects, and how to use `localStorage` in JavaScript. One challenge I faced was getting the task list to update correctly after adding or changing a task. I also had an issue with the JavaScript not loading, which I later fixed by correcting the script tag.

I approached these problems step-by-step by testing small parts of the code, reading the error messages in the browser console, and doing research online. Once I fixed the main issues, it was a nice feeling to see the app working!

If I had more time, I would add the ability to delete tasks, color-code different task statuses, and maybe allow editing of tasks. I also want to learn how to store tasks using a database in the future.
